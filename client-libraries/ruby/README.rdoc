A ruby client library for the redis key value storage system:
http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/README

redis is a key value store with some interesting features:

1. fast
2. keys are strings but values can have types of "NONE","STRING","LIST","SET"
   list's can be atomicaly push'd, pop'd and lpush'd, lpop'd and indexed so you 
   can store things like lists of comments under one key and still be able to 
   append comments without reading and putting back the whole list.
